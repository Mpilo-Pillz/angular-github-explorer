## Challenge Solution Notes

- I created a `develop` branch, which serves as the primary development branch branching off from the `main` branch.
- For new tasks I created `feature` branches from the most recent version of the `develop` branch to manage individual components of the project.
- I kept the `feature` branches post-merge rather than deleting them. This decision was made to provide reviewers with a clear view of my branching strategy and to demonstrate how I organized my work during the assessment.

### branching

In this project, I use specific tags for branches to organize and manage changes efficiently. Each branch tag corresponds to a specific type of task as outlined below:

**Use Case (UC):** `uc-number/branch-name`
Example: `uc-1/branch-name`
**Description:** These branches are linked directly to use cases specified in the project's assessment notes. They are used for implementing features or fixes directly related to a defined use case.

**Documentation (DOC):** `doc-number/branch-name`
Example: `doc-1/branch-name`
**Description:** These branches are for tasks related to the creation or updating of documentation about the solutions. This might involve updating the project README, code comments, or any external documentation that explains project components.

**Technical Debt (TD):** `td-number/branch-name`
Example: `td-1/branch-name`
**Description:** Used for improving the codebase's readability and maintainability. This could include refactoring code, improving performance, or addressing issues that are not immediate bugs but could hinder future development if not resolved.

_These tags correspond to ticket numbers that are typically autogenerated by task management platforms such as Jira._

## Running the Project Locally

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
