## Challenge Solution Notes

- I created a `develop` branch, which serves as the primary development branch branching off from the `main` branch.
- For new tasks I created `feature` branches from the most recent version of the `develop` branch to manage individual components of the project.
- I kept the `feature` branches post-merge rather than deleting them. This decision was made to provide reviewers with a clear view of my branching strategy and to demonstrate how I organized my work during the assessment.

### branching

branches are tagged with `uc-number`, `doc-number`, `td-number`.

- **uc-number:** e.g `uc-1/branch-name`. UC stands for Use Case mapping to the use case specified in the assessment notes.
- **doc-number:** e.g `doc-1/branch-name`. DOC stands for documentation representing tasks related to adding notes about my solution. This would represent a technical documentation in the work place.
- **td-number:** e.g `td-1/branch-name`. TD stands for Technical Debt. This represents tasks related to improving the readability and maintainability of the code base.

These represent ticket numbers that would be autogenerated on task management platforms such as Jira.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
